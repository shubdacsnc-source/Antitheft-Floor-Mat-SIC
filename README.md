🛡️ IoT-Based Anti-Theft Smart Floor Mat

An intelligent security system that detects unauthorized entry using a pressure-sensitive floor mat integrated with IoT technology. When pressure is detected, the system instantly sends alerts to the owner via the internet, enhancing real-time security monitoring for homes, offices, and restricted areas.

📌 Overview

The IoT-Based Anti-Theft Floor Mat is designed to act as a smart intrusion detection system. It uses pressure sensors embedded inside a floor mat to detect footsteps. Once triggered, the system processes the signal through a microcontroller and sends instant notifications to the user through a mobile app, email, or web dashboard.

This project combines embedded systems and IoT to provide a low-cost, reliable, and scalable security solution.

🚀 Features

👣 Pressure-based intrusion detection

📡 Real-time IoT alerts (Wi-Fi enabled)

🔔 Buzzer or alarm activation

📲 Mobile / Web notification system

📊 Data logging for activity monitoring

⚡ Low power consumption

🛠️ Technologies Used

Microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266 / ESP32 / Arduino)

Force/Pressure Sensor (FSR or load sensor)

Wi-Fi Module (if not built-in)

IoT Platform (e.g., Blynk, Firebase, MQTT, ThingSpeak)

Embedded C / Arduino IDE

⚙️ How It Works

The pressure sensor detects weight applied to the floor mat.

The microcontroller reads the sensor data.

If the pressure exceeds a predefined threshold:

An alarm/buzzer is triggered.

A notification is sent via the IoT platform.

The event can be logged for monitoring and analysis.
